Some time ago, when I started as a software developer, I started thinking about creating something to have a development environment ready to use. So I tested many online options to get this thing, but the challenge was my environment.
So I'm a guy that likes to test a lot of things, and I chose a collection of software, some of those are for specific uses, like VSCode, which is very good for writing JS code, Sublime is incredible for opening big files and write short notes - because I like to use markdown. And I also use some tools that make my environment so flexible, like the ASDF-VM, which allows me to have a lot of language versions on the same machine. But now I know that you are thinking about "Why not use Docker?" so I  use it and many other very useful software, tools and fine-tuning things.
Today, I have a WIP repository with scripts to prepare my development environment.
Feel free to share and collaborate.
DonÂ´t forget to put a star on the repo!
